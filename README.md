# Bacterial-Plus
Bacterial Plus is a software that simulates bacterial conjugation process in different environments.
Inspired by my research experience at University of Waterloo on CRISPR bacterial conjugation,
I developed Bacterial Plus to help aid in observing generational changes in different types of bacteria's,
by controlling environmental factors, conjugation rate, and frame rates per second. 
It applies concepts of 2-D Arrays to keep track of characteristics unique to each bacteria, such as fertility and plasmid factor,
as well as its type, and simulates the process for upto 10000 different types of bacteria. 
The program is written in Processing's Java Mode.
